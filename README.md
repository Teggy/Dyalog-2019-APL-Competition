# In retrospect: The Dyalog 2019 APL Problem Solving Competition

In 2019 — entirely on a whim — I participated in
[Dyalog's](https://www.dyalog.com) yearly [APL Problem Solving
Competition](https://www.dyalog.com/student-competition.htm). I am sold
to programming paradigms that support declarative and bulk-oriented data
processing: I speak SQL daily and APL fits the bill just as well.

Back in 2019, I had not yet written a single line of APL. Still, I
enjoyed the competition immensely—so much so that I dabble with
different array programming languages to this day.  If nothing else,
thinking in arrays definitely had an influence on how I think about and
write SQL.

This is an archive of my solutions to those problems I tackled during
the competition's [Phase 1](Phase1/) and [Phase 2](Phase2/).  You can find
Dyalog's original problem statements here:

- [Phase 2 problems (2019)](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/files/student_competition/2019_problems_phase2.pdf)

Fun times!
And thank, you APL.
